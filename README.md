# Mastodon Archive Viewer - Zero's fork

An offline web page to view a [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org) archive. It gives a powerful data table to tell you what the composition of all your toots is. There is also a line graph telling you the tooting trend. You can select a period of time to view.

* 05/06/2021, Zero
    * i18n supported. Can be viewed in Chinese or English now. A shoutout to [this code](https://codesandbox.io/s/ipfeu)
* 08/10/2021, Zero
    * use ðŸ”‘ to mark unlisted toot, because ðŸ”“ (unlisted) is not often easy to distinguish from ðŸ”’ (followers-only)
    * fix the problem that `captionText` is not defined: `var captionText = document.getElementById("caption");`
    * no need to unzip `archive-xxx.tar.gz` file anymore, just select directly the archive file in browser, then everything should be fine. This feature benefits from [pako](https://github.com/nodeca/pako) and [js-untar](https://github.com/InvokIT/js-untar), which are greatly appreciated. (and this [code](https://stackoverflow.com/a/65448758) provides an out-of-the-box idea)
    * add the time zone feature, use your system time zone by default, and can be customized.
* 08/11/2021, Zero
    * tell you the fedi sites whose users you usually interacted with. At first I want to show the users you most interacted with, but the toots of [pleroma](https://pleroma.social) users in `likes.json` and `bookmarks.json` don't have a link formated as `https://<mastodon.example.com>/users/<username>/statuses/<status_id>`, they are like `https://<pleroma.example.com>/objects/<object-id>`. It is not fair to exclude them.

### Linux

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/zero-mstd/mav-z.git
$ cd mav-z
$ firefox archive_page.html
```

3. Hit the green button `Code`;
4. Choose `Download ZIP`;
5. Unzip what you downloaded (should be `mav-z-master.zip`) and enter this folder;
6. Open the `archive_page.html` in your browser;
7. Follow the instructions, choose and open the entire `.tar.gz` archive file you got from the 1st step.

## Next steps:
- [x] separate page on only toots & media
	- [x] make medias easier to view
	- [x] click to open pictures (why `addEventListener click` didn't work...)
- [ ] prettier interface
- [x] select a period of toots
- [x]  (branch: exhibition) assistant for my season's exhibition
- [x] open the .tar.gz directly
- [x] the display of vedio problem, width out of box
- [ ] add reverse mode to view all toots
- [ ] total(with_reply_ct) + boost_ct - direct_ct != display_ct, why?
- [x] i18n support. use pure js, with data attributes. see [this link](https://codeburst.io/translating-your-website-in-pure-javascript-98b9fa4ce427)
- [x] more information? for example, the one you liked the most, the one you boost the mostâ€¦
- [x] add a line graph, maybe?
- [x] time zone problem
