# Mastodon Archive Viewer - Zero's fork

An offline web page to view a [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org) archive. It gives a powerful data table to tell you what the composition of all your toots is. There is also a line graph telling you the tooting trend. You can select a period of time to view.

The branch "exhibition" is for my season's toots exhibition.

- [x] open the .tar.gz directly
- [x] the display of vedio problem, width out of box
- [ ] add reverse mode to view all toots
- [ ] total(with_reply_ct) + boost_ct - direct_ct != display_ct, why?
- [x] i18n support. use pure js, with data attributes. see [this link](https://codeburst.io/translating-your-website-in-pure-javascript-98b9fa4ce427)
- [ ] more information? for example, the one you liked the most, the one you boost the mostâ€¦
