# Usage
* Clone the whole repo by using `git clone https://github.com/zero-mstd/mav-z.git`. Place all of them in the root of the archive (the folder that has `outbox.json` and `media_attachments/` in it).
* Open `archive_page.html` in your web browser. Open the `actor.json` and `outbox.json` file from within the page and it will load it.


# Next steps:

- [x] separate page on only toots & media
	- [x] make medias easier to view
	- [x] click to open pictures (why `addEventListener click` didn't work...)
- [ ] prettier interface
- [x] select a period of toots
- [ ] assistant for my season's exhibition
- [ ] open the .tar.gz directly
- [ ] the display of vedio problem, width out of box
- [ ] add reverse mode to view all toots
- [ ] total(with_reply_ct) + boost_ct - direct_ct != display_ct, why?
- [ ] i18n support. use pure js, with data attributes. see [this link](https://codeburst.io/translating-your-website-in-pure-javascript-98b9fa4ce427)
- [ ] more information? for example, the one you liked the most, the one you boost the mostâ€¦
- [x] add a line graph, maybe?

Open to suggestions. Chinese and English ok.
